            <p class="general_P">
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Amateur radio operators can significantly benefit humanity during
                earthquakes and other unusual circumstances. The two major earthquakes that struck Turkey in quick
                succession on February 6, 2023, killing tens of thousands of people, provide the most recent
                illustration of this. After the earthquake, there was a communication breakdown that hindered
                aid and search and rescue operations for about a week. Amateur radio operators who banded together
                during this time provided government institutions incredible support. By using their own two feet,
                bicycles, motorcycles, and cars, some individuals made significant contributions to the crisis
                management effort.

                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Similar conditions can be seen in Turkey during the 7.2-magnitude
                earthquake that struck there in 1999. As you can see, no matter how sophisticated the infrastructure of
                what we call modern communication methods becomes, no matter how sophisticated technology advances, they
                have the potential to become passive and render people blind or deaf in unusual circumstances. The
                skills and responsibilities amateur radio operators have developed in traditional communication
                methods—which may be considered unnecessary and primitive in regular life—come to the aid of people at
                this point and can be extremely beneficial in moments of need.
