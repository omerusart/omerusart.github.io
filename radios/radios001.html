            <p class="miniTitlesOfDocument"> What is ham radio?</p>

            <p class="general_P">
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Amateur radio operators can still transmits messages even when other
                systems, such as
                the internet, conventional phones, mobile phones, and regular phones, are down or overloaded. The hobby
                of radio amateurs, also known as "hams," is radio technology. However, it's also a service that has been
                important in saving lives when conventional communication networks failed.
            </p>
            <p class="general_P">
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In Turkiye, as in every other nation, this hobby requires obtaining a
                license, which is subject to examination. However, getting a license isn't even the initial action in
                this process. Obtaining a license is only the start of learning because there is so much to learn. While
                conventional communication channels are frequently used, amateur radio operators, who combine analog and
                digital radio technologies, are constantly expanding their capabilities.
            </p>
            <p class="general_P">
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp If you delve deep enough, you will discover that using radio frequencies,
                without the need for internet and GSM connections, you can reach people in regions sometimes thousands
                of kilometers away using pure radio signals. You can even send them photos, location information,
                weather reports, and emails. In the initial stages of amateur radio, after establishing voice
                communication using analog radio frequencies, a whole world opens up. With determination, research, and
                a learning process, you can acquire many skills.
