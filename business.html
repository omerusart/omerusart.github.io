            <p class="general_P">My relationship with the Fusion 360 software started during my first year of college,
                and through
                committed study and project experiences, it has since grown to be a significant aspect of my life. I
                arrived at the realization that I could now share this expertise to other people after spending more
                than 2,000 hours of my time to numerous projects, both academic and personal. I began offering Fusion
                360 tutorials and working on personal freelance projects while continuing my academic studies.

                training with more than 10 learners, which has enabled us to develop a significant level of proficiency
